# MarginalModelCifti

The goal of MarginalModelCifti is to perform marginal models on CIFTI processed

subfunctions. Advanced users can use the subfunctions to construct their own
analytic pipeline. However, this is not recommend for beginning users.

## Example

This is a basic example for how to use MarginalModelCifti:
